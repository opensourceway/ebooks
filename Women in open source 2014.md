# Make money and have fun in open source
By Christie Eller (originally published February 2014)

Women in open source. Women in programming. Women in tech at all. Where are they?
We're familiar with the statistics, and we've seen the photos from the tech conferences. Seas full of men. It requires patience to scan for the odd female in those auditoriums. It's a popular topic, this scarcity of women in technology, one of the hip things to whine about these days. It's politically correct to blame the male "priesthood" in Silicon Valley. Ask Paul Graham. He took it in the ribs after a few reckless comments about the funding practices of his startup seed accelerator, Y Combinator. He was quoted as saying, "God knows what you would do to get 13 year old girls interested in computers. I would have to stop and think about that," in a recent article. Ouch. But, really, is he so wrong?
I have an 11 year old daughter. Even though she sees me sitting at my computer for ungodly hours of the day making a living for her, she's a lot more interested in watching Katy Perry on YouTube than learning how to write code on Khan Academy. Why is that? Coding is fun. Writing some lines of PHP, hitting enter, and watching the look of an entire website change in an instant, now that's exhilarating!

Well... it doesn't wear a candy striped leotard and strut around through a maze of life-sized lollipops.
For years, I've been wishing somebody like Wired Magazine or Opensource.com would do an annual "Sexiest Geek Alive" issue, like People magazine does. Give me Matt Mullenweg, Linus Torvalds, or Nick Roach over Adam Levine any day. I'm literally weak in the knees thinking of the long list I could make. Is there anything sexier than a man who can DO something?! I had come to the conclusion that what the open source community needed was more sex appeal, starting with some geeky pinup boys. Then, I read an article by Sarah Pressler which convinced me of the danger of that kind of thinking.

I've realized that's not exactly the best direction, as fun as it sounds at first. Boys might attract girls... but eventually, what we want is more females getting enchanted with the mysteries of open source. We want them to feel the rush of writing code or contributing to an open source project. They'll get interested when they think it might be as fun as putting on makeup or listening to a pop song. So, instead of whining about the dearth of women in technology, let's show them how fun it is!

Seeing incredible, powerful women in the community will draw the girls in. Female role models who are making money with open source, and having fun doing it... that will keep them interested. You can't expect a young girl to imagine the possibility of a successful career as a woman in technology, if she has no idea what that looks like. Be the change you want to see, right?

There are a lot of us "being it" already. There are also some incredible organizations contributing to the cause. I think this is one of our best tools to make a difference in the balance of the genders in our field, encouraging girls to join in the fun. I know firsthand about one of these organizations, because it made a huge impact on my own career in open source.

When I applied to become an intern with the GNOME Outreach Program for Women in 2011, I had already used open source software for many years. I am not an average GMONE applicant. Fortunately, they are usually younger than I am, and therefore, will probably be more influential on their peers. I had co-owned an ISP that ran exclusively on open source software and had used only open source tools myself since I had begun using a computer for anything more than word processing. I didn't need to be convinced that it was viable. I knew it worked. But, I was in a transition period in my life.
We had sold our Internet service, and the economy was sagging. An internship was perfect for me at the time. My next move was up in the air, and the opportunity to contribute to the open source software that I had benefited from for many years sounded great. I was accepted to participate in web design and marketing tasks for GNOME, and it ended up shaping a future for me in web design. The internship solidified my devotion to the open source ideal, furthered my experience in web design, and reminded me that the culture of technology is ever so interesting and inspiring. My experience with the GNOME community taught me how effective the open source collaborative model is. The opportunity to hop on IRC chat when you're stuck on a problem or need some input is invaluable, and the end product is so much better with a melding of minds.

I was hooked. My future was certainly going to be in open source software, and I thank GNOME for that. Organizations like them are changing the world one woman at a time. Each of these women is becoming a model for the young girls behind them. The fact that the Executive Director of GNOME, Karen Sandler, is just the sort of role model I'm talking about, was icing on the cake.

I recently attended WordCamp, a WordPress conference, and I was so happy to see the vitality of that open source community. People definitely knew they were working with a different model, a community model, and they love it. Many of the businesses represented at the conference, like 10upfor example, contribute a significant amount of their employees' time to WordPress core itself. They get it. There were a lot of women there, not enough, but quite a few. Women like Sarah Pressler and Natalie MacLees were energetic and inspiring. WordPress is attracting women into open source jobs, as well it should.

I now own a freelance WordPress web design business that is growing daily. I run Ubuntu and the GNOME desktop and use only open source tools like Inkscape, GIMP, LibreOffice, and WordPress. I am making a good living using open source. And it's fun, it really is. I get to make things all day long, beautiful things.
Are you listening, girls?

# 5 tips: Leverage user-centered design in your open source project
By Georgia Bullen (originally published January 2014)

When I first started working at the Open Technology Institute (OTI), I was consistently challenged with the question: "Why would a UX designer want to work at an open source organization?" The truth, in my opinion, is almost all design and usability work is by its nature open source.

Designers build on and adapt from design patterns that we see and experience in the world around us. We are constantly sharing and testing our ideas with our peers and collaboratively iterating on concepts because good design is widely understandable. There are great resources around the Internet [see below] on usability and design best practices, and many of the open source user interface frameworks are building these principles into their toolkits, so that the lines between developers, designers, etc are even more blurred.
The question remains though: Why do we so rarely see usability professionals and designers in the open source community, and how we might begin to change that?

Open source processes and projects are also not highlighted as frequently in design and UX schools and conferences, limiting the awareness in design communities of the needs in the field. Additionally, as I touched on above, the evolution of software frameworks, libraries, and toolkits, such as Twitter Bootstrap, and AngularJS are allowing the roles to blur, and making it easier to "fake it until you make it." While on the one hand it's become clear that usability and design are crucial needs for both user facing and developer facing projects (APIs need to be usable too!), there seems to be a divide as to the percentage of designers in proprietary versus open source software. In the past, small projects have viewed user experience (UX) as a luxury and therefore not invested in staffing their UX needs. Also, I imagine that the market demand for designers keeps many of them occupied in companies who can pay them competitively, where many (not all!) of open source projects are volunteer run, or operate on smaller budgets.
However, I believe that one of the main reasons that we don’t see as many designers and usability professionals in open source is that they aren't sure how to participate in projects and may not have had exposure to open source projects in the past.

At Open Technology Institute (OTI), we've been working on opening our user feedback process as a way to improve our internal processes and collaboration, engage our user community more, promote non-developer contributions, and think more broadly about how open source process plays a role in the Commotion Wireless project, a free and open-source communication tool that uses mobile phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized mesh networks.
For the official Version 1 release of the software, we decided to do a full overhaul of the user interface, focused primarily on the version for wireless routers, but also on aligning the other platforms (Mac, Linux, Android, Windows, iOS) to the router. Mesh networking firmware is not your everyday project—our development team frequently is focused on how to add more functionality while simultaneously making the files smaller so that they can fit on hardware with very little space (only 5.2 MB!). Meanwhile our field team, of which I am part, is researching how mesh networks can leverage existing social relationships, developing training and adoption frameworks, and testing these ideas out with communities who are interested in experimenting with community-owned infrastructure.
In my next article, I will expand on these 5 tips that we learned from our user-centered design review of the Commotion interface.

## 5 tips for leveraging user-centered design in your open source project
1. Track usability and design issues.
Gather context as well as feedback. Don't respond (with software/design changes) to each piece of feedback. Synthesize issues for themes.
2. Understand who you want to design for.
When making design decisions, you often have to prioritize which type of user to design for—novice or expert users.
3. Make prototypes.
Leverage the style of the prototype (low-fidelity vs high-fidelity) to get the type of feedback you need.
4. Understand how the software works from the user's perspective.
5. Use usability/design iterations to build your community: hackathons, mailing lists, and distributed tools.

# Got questions on open hardware? Ask this engineer
By Limor Fried (originally published January 2014)

One of my favorite quotes is "We are what we celebrate." Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST Robotics, says this and it comes up on an almost daily basis one way or another in my work in open source hardware and education. One of the challenges of getting more young people into engineering and computer programming is that we're collectively competing with the high profile status that becoming a famous, professional athlete or musician, or reality show star, promises. I don't expect the mass media to change, because change happens from small groups of motivated people. And, this is where the maker, hacker, and open source software and hardware communities are making great progress.

Maker Faire is a worldwide event that was started almost 10 years ago. On a yearly basis, almost 500,000 people visit a Maker Faire or Mini Maker Faire event. It's nearly impossible to classify who is going: it's young people, seniors, men, women, boys and girls. It's a place and event where all makers are celebrated. Sherry Huss and her team at Maker Media created a place, an event, and a platform that has inspired millions of people. If you want to see more makers, participate in a Maker Faire either by attending or exhibiting. If you know a young person that is a maker, it's an excellent way to get them in the spotlight.

The Open Source Hardware Summit was started in 2010 and was co-chaired by Alicia Gibb and Ayah Bdeir. This yearly event has hundreds of open source software and hardware developers coming together to share what is going on in the newly defined world of open hardware. It's been so popular a foundation has spun out: The Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA), with Alicia Gibb as Executive Director. The Summit is now co-chaired by Addie Wagenknecht. If you're wondering what OSHWA is up to, check out: BROADENING THE OPEN SOURCE LANDSCAPE: Insights from the Open Source Hardware Association, by Gabriella Levine, President of the OSHWA board.

And last up, I have my own personal story of celebrating the change we want to see in the world. Each week I do two live internet video shows:
Ask an Engineer: I answer questions about electronics, coding, and more. And, often I have guests! One of my guests was my friend Amanda aka "W0z"—she is a staff Electrical Engineer at Wyss Institute and formerly an applications Engineer at Analog Devices. She speaks a million words a minute and the community gets to ask a ton of questions about engineering and the new field of biohacking she's involved in. Another time, a parent of a kid emailed us to say that they watch the show, "Ask an Engineer," with their daughter each week, and because she's only seen women talking about engineering on the show she recently asked her parents, "Do boys do engineering too?"
Show-and-Tell: People from around of the world of all skill levels and backgrounds show off their latest projects. This show is my favorite 30 minutes of the week! We showcase everything from net-connected cat feeders to girl scout troops' robotics projects. It's a sampling of all that's going on in the world of makers.
What an interesting world we can create together where perceptions can change just by celebrating each others work, by sharing and putting value back in, and through open software and open hardware.
We are what we celebrate.

Findings from working on Red Hat's installer
By Anne Mulhern (originally published February 2014)
Until I started graduate school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I had never heard of open source. However, every computer science department of any age and stature uses open source software to support their infrastructure. One or another variant of Linux was always being installed on our desktops by the departmental systems administrators, and many academic programs are open source. I accepted the whole situation more or less as I found it.
Open source became more relevant to me when I joined the Cooperative Bug Isolation (CBI) project. This project used open source software as test objects for automated bug finding. My supervisor on the project, Professor Ben Liblit, had written a short paper, The Open Source Proving Grounds, describing his experiences and evaluating the suitability of open source software for bug-finding project like his. Although the paper was published in 2005, many of his observations are still relevant today.
Once I started thinking about open source software, and especially when I began to study some individual applications, I was dismayed to discover that some of it is very poorly written and consequently riddled with bugs. Naively, I had assumed that any software that anyone would choose to distribute would be at least as carefully crafted as the software I myself, a mere graduate student, wrote. Then, as now, people will use software if it works well enough for their purposes, regardless of what the code looks like, even if the code is exposed for all to see.
Later, I worked on extending some macros in the Chromium project to gather CBI-type data. These extensions were never intended to be incorporated into the project in any permanent way; you will certainly not find them there today. The Chromium project was a very disciplined one, and even though the code I wrote was not ever going to be part of the project my patches were required to conform to comprehensive and detailed specifications and were reviewed thoroughly before they were accepted.
My personal computer is a Mac, but as everybody knows, that's just Unix under the hood, so I download, install, and often use numerous open source applications. I've seen some applications, like LyX, mature. Over the time I've known about LyX, my personal evaluation has evolved from "useless" to "by far the best choice available." I would still like to understand how an ambitious open source project like LyX can last through its early, vulnerable years.
By the time I left the CBI project, I had interacted in some way with a variety of open source projects, some apparently emerging from chaos and others emerging from a very disciplined development process, some terribly impressive and others not. After graduation, I held a series of teaching positions and fell back on my old ways. I was grateful that the software was there, used it regularly, contributed the odd bug report, and thought very little about it otherwise. Occasionally, I thought that I ought to find out more about this open source phenomenon and how it managed to sustain itself, but I was always far too busy.
My chance came when I decided to leave academia and enter industry. I had not previously programmed in industry, but I had done extensive development work for the CBI project in a number of languages and for a number of different purposes. Until I interned with the Yocto Project last summer however I knew nothing about the mechanisms of open source development or communication within a possibly geographically distributed team. I learned about the overwhelming number of emails that everybody inevitably gets and also about the utility of IRC. It was through that internship that I became facile with git.
Since I joined Red Hat in September 2013, I've been learning much more about the development cycle and its requirements, although because it hasn't been long, I haven't made it through a full cycle yet. Since I've become an open source contributor, I've started to see open source as a virtue in itself and have become much more likely to seek out open source alternatives to various applications. I'm also more likely to post bug-reports that are a bit higher up on the bug food chain—in the Python standard library, for example, rather than in some application written in Python. I see more problems as opportunities for open source collaboration than I did formerly. I would never have dreamed that open source could be so successful and only hope that its success will grow.
At Red Hat, I spend almost all my time working on the installer, focusing mostly on its storage component, blivet. The installer, Anaconda, guarantees that it will not actually do anything to your disks until you have made all your choices and pressed the big red button; at this point it ought to implement all your choices without crashing. This is a hard problem to solve, as there may be surprising restrictions on what the different tools that Anaconda relies on can do, and there are surprising interactions between different choices that you make. There is always tension between allowing the user the most flexibility and, at the same time, guaranteeing that the choices they make can be carried out.
Blivet, the storage component, is responsible for handling devices and device formatting. It must present a uniform interface for a variety of different file systems, for a variety of different devices, and for a variety of different architectures. This is like the device driver problem, where individual devices may be very different, but the drivers must all present the same Application Programming Interface (API). File systems, for example, can be very different from each other, as the file system designers do not have the problems of installers uppermost in their minds when designing their file systems. Moreover, most file systems do not present an API; blivet must generate the necessary commands for each file system's Command-line Interface (CLI), which can be a moving target.
Although Anaconda is a substantial application in its own right, and blivet is a substantial library, by their very nature they must depend on other significant applications like package installers and file system utilities to coordinate the actions of these various applications and interrogating them to discover relevant system state. Frequently, these interactions are made much more brittle because the application must be invoked by means of its CLI and must be interrogated by reading and parsing output which has a format that may change with the next update.
An installer like Anaconda is certainly an extreme example of an application that must rely on other applications. However, automation is the norm rather than the exception today and many applications, especially of the kind that Anaconda and blivet rely on, may expect to be invoked automatically as often as they are invoked by a human being. The more successful they are, the more likely this is to be the case.
I believe that the open source community as a whole would benefit if more open source developers considered the API and associated bindings as primary and the CLI as of secondary importance. Ideally, applications would be designed from the start with a well-defined API, a set of bindings that evolved with the API, and a CLI (if one was necessary) that was defined in a scripting language that made use of the bindings. Not only would this make the application ripe for automation, but it would likely have the added benefit of making the API better defined and more robust.

The participatory nature of the Internet strengthens fan communities
By Kendra Mack (originally published January 2014)
Whether the big media producers like it or not, digital technologies have made it easier than ever for popular culture fans to create remixes or derivative works from their favorite movies, TV shows, books, and other media. And the participatory nature of the Internet has arguably helped broaden the popular definition of a "fan community" from something exclusive to comic and sci-fi fans to being inclusive of many genres and people. This includes giving wider exposure to a vast and yet often overlooked demographic in pop fandom—women—and their influence on mainstream media stories.
To appreciate the importance of women in fandom may first require recognition of the importance of fan communities at large. Some are likely to view fan fiction, fan art, and video mashups as wastes of time and creativity. Why not just create something original? Rather than passively consuming the stories big media organizations put in front of them, fan communities participate in the texts, exploring and sharing new meanings that the original producers may not have intended or even imagined. The digitization of media has made this participation even more fluid and opened new outlets for meaning-making, such as creating fake Twitter accounts for pop characters.
Free culture advocate Lawrence Lessig calls this a shift from a Read/Only (RO) culture to a Read/Write (RW) culture. This shift has been traditionally met with pushback from media gatekeepers who want to deter remixing of their copyrighted productions. Safeguards such as Creative Commons licenses and fair use laws are meant to protect and even empower fans to remix the stories, characters, themes, and ideologies most of us consume on a near-daily basis. Media is to storytelling as code is to software—both are better when open.
But female fans have long participated in (and led) fan communities before this RW shift, remixing and making new meanings from fictional texts. Henry Jenkins has written about the influence of television fan fiction writers in the 1980s, many of whom were women. Some wrote to refocus the stories, such as Star Trek and Dr. Who, onto the more minor female characters: "Fan writers reclaim female experiences from the margins of male-centered texts, offering readers the kinds of heroic women still rarely available elsewhere in popular culture." This practice of fan refocalization continues today with shows like Adventure Time, a (personal favorite) cartoon with two male character leads that has many fans creating derivative fiction and art focused on the secondary female characters. The show also received positive fan reaction and high ratings after airing an episode in which the gender of all the characters are reversed, not to mention a slew of fan art and fiction involving the gender-swapped heroines.
Despite women’s long-time involvement in pop culture fandom, we are often still considered anomalies in traditional fan communities. A September 2012 Time magazine article about female fandom comments that, "While male geeks are allowed into the clubhouse quietly and without much concern, women expressing their fandom are being increasingly treated with suspicion about their interests." Despite barriers, both by gender and by stringent copyright laws, it’s hard to deny that female fans and their creative derivative works are having some effect on the stories the media industry produces.
When female fans are more widely recognized as an important and influential audience, producers are likely to create and sell stories with themes and characters that do not alienate women. A recent example is the successful Hunger Games book series and movies, which feature a strong female character as the lead. And with higher demand for media that are inclusive of women may come more opportunities for female writers, directors, and producers who are underrepresented in film and other media industries. Like with the meritocracy of open source, media stories that are left open to participation from fan communities are likely to evolve into ones that connect with broader audiences. And communities that include women have an opportunity to influence stories to be more inclusive and meaningful for us all.

Call to all open source communities: Emphasize inclusion
By Meg Ford (originally published January 2014)
As a woman in open source, I have found that the values of community, open development, and flat organizational structure appeal equally to both men and women. The ability of local organizers to freely define what type of culture they are building allows them to adapt in order to appeal to the surrounding culture, while striving to improve access.
The gender balance in the field of design is the opposite of the FOSS community, because the majority of visual artists are female. In art, gender is discussed openly as an aspect of the theory used to explain visual communication. For example, part of the typical peer-review process is critique, the goal of which is to contextualize visual communication by discussing the culture, gender, identity, economics, and psychological factors which influenced the artwork, so the artist can understand how they personally fit into the community in which they practice. I began as an outsider to both technology and the FOSS community, so it was both interesting and frustrating to realize that much of the communication and organization of FOSS communities was framed without acknowledgment to the diversity of communication styles and the backgrounds of potential community members.
In 2011, I was accepted to the OPW to work on high contrast icon themes for the GNOME desktop. This started my deep dive into the fascinating world of Linux. Having access to an open code base, sharing my work in the open, and receiving constant feedback from the community was overwhelming at first. The learning curve was steep, but the excitement I felt about having access to open knowledge, the support of a community dedicated to sharing knowledge freely, and to pushing the boundaries of what we did kept me coming back for more even on the most frustrating days.
My OPW internship brought me into the FOSS community. It also taught me to talk freely about my experiences as a woman in the computer science field, and sometimes that means knocking on the same doors over and over until you are let in. Sometimes it means acknowledging that communication styles needs to shift in order to emphasize inclusion. Other times it means speaking up about what your community values and how to allocate resources to benefit all participants equally. OPW was the first door to open for me, and my involvement showed me that persistence, hard work, and enthusiasm can bring success no matter who you are or where you start from.
As time went on I became involved in coding for GNOME. In 2012, I started to contribute to GNOME’s Documents application, which was the first application to be developed in the new GNOME 3 style. Because the style is still in its early stages, the themes and widgets are being prototyped in the applications before they are integrated into GTK+ (the widget library) and the standard desktop themes. Last summer I wrote my own GNOME application: a sound recorder for the desktop. I started by planning my code to fulfill the requirements of a series of mockups by a community member. I went on to code the application as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project.
During the initial development phase I worked with Reda Lazri (the original designer), Sebastian Dröge (a GStreamer core maintainer who mentored me), Hylke Bons, and Garrett LeSage (both of whom are community members and design for GNOME). GSoC allowed me to immerse myself in GNOME’s developer community and learn about the code base from core contributors.
When a fellow GNOME contributor, Jim Campbell, suggested that we start a group to focus on GNOME and GNU/Linux, I saw it as a way to give back to my community and work to increase diversity. The FOSS community in Chicago is small, and for the first year I was the only woman who attended our events. From the beginning we emphasized that our group was open to anyone who was interested in participating by adopting a code of conduct. As time went on our community began to grow and started to be more representative of the larger community here in the city. Engaging women has happened slowly but without any special intervention on our part.
We invite members to bring their projects to hackfests and share their knowledge by giving talks. People have come to work on GTK+ bindings for the Go programming language, documentation for Gedit, the fundraising campaign for MediaGoblin, and the website for the Open Science Framework, among other things. Talks have ranged from a recent SaltStack tutorial, which our members participated in using their own four-server demo environments running on server space donated by Rackspace—to talks on Wayland, Emacs, and personal data security. All of the projects and presentations center around the use of open source technologies. Our role as organizers is to encourage participation and free exchange of ideas and resources among participants.
Being a woman in computer science is both an exciting and challenging experience. To me it means being exposed to emerging technologies, solving new and difficult problems, and working to promote Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in my local community.
I think that outreach can be successfully addressed using the same template as other questions in open source: by recognizing diversity as a key element of success, by facilitating transparency and equal access to knowledge, and by letting the community organize itself around a shared vision. Having women who are visibly engaged in and promoting involvement in the community seems to be one way to send a clear message that women can participate and succeed in FOSS.

Heard of the GNOME Outreach Program for Women? Learn more today.
By Máirín Duffy, Interview with Marie Nordin (originally published February 2014)
Starting this past December, the GNOME Outreach Program for Women (OPW) welcomed a new crop of promising young female contributors to several open source projects. These women are currently halfway through their internships, working to improve open source projects across a number of disciplines including code development, visual and UX design, internationalization, documentation, and community-building.
Marie Nordin is one of the OPW interns for the Fedora Project. She is the visual designer currently in charge of badge design for Fedora Badges, an open badges based web application that helps to encourage contributors in the Fedora community by awarding them with badges for their efforts. (For example, Marie is the proud recipient of the "Pixel Ninja" badge for her work on the Fedora Design team.) I interviewed Marie, and she shared how she came to open source, what open source projects she's currently involved with, and her advice for other young women interested in getting involved.
What does open source mean to you?
Open source to me means freely bringing beauty and knowledge into the world. When I create something that is beautiful, I am more than excited to let all people see it and to share in the knowledge it can provide.
When did you first learn about open source?
I first learned about open source in college when my computer crashed and my college roommate installed Ubuntu. What impressed me the most about using Ubuntu was the free software that was available. After being trained on Illustrator and Photoshop since the age of 14, I have to admit I was seriously confused using Inkscape and GIMP for the first time. But, I knew the value these programs held and after some effort I got the hang of them. Now I use Inkscape everyday.
How did you first get involved with open source?
My first open source project was designing a set of logos for FOSS@RIT and the FOSSBox (which are both located at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), my alma mater). FOSS@RIT is a lab located at RIT that focuses on educating students about and getting them involved in open source. During my time working with the lab, I also helped them design posters for conferences, local events, and slide decks.
How is your Open Source Outreach Program for Women internship going so far? What are you working on?
I am working on two things right now: guidelines and badges. The guidelines will be a standard for all artists and non-artists to use when creating artwork for the Fedora Badges project. Categories, color palettes, notes on typography, strokes, and the usage of the different reoccurring characters will all be outlined in the guide.
Eventually there will be a design resource page with the badge guidelines, templates, and fun badge content! I am also making badges... and it has been SO much fun illustrating. I have over 40 badge designs live on the Fedora Badges website. Including badges currently in the queue, that's 60+ badge designs in total (and still counting). My internship is going very well. I have been very productive and I have received positive feedback all around.
Would you recommend the Outreach Program for Women to other young women? If so, what advice do you have for applicants?
Yes, I would recommend the Outreach Program for Women to others! My advice is to get involved as early and as much as possible. I found the easiest way to do this was to make myself available on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) as much as possible.
Do you use open source tools in your work? Which ones?
Like I said, I use Inkscape everyday! Even after using Inkscape for 4+ years, I am still learning how to utilize all of the tools. There are a surprising amount of tutorials in existence and a lot of people who are willing to help you learn. I have not run across something I could not accomplish with Inkscape that I could accomplish with Illustrator. I also use GIMP and Colloquy. In my opinion all of these programs stand up to their commercial equivalents.
What's your advice for other young women looking to get involved in open source? Where should they start?
If you are just starting out, ladies, you should apply to be an OPW intern! Another good place to start is by finding a community of people who are doing open source and get to know them, whether it is in IRC or locally. Find a niche where your skills are needed and do great work.
Where can we see more of your work?
You can see more of my artwork on my tumblr. I use it to post all of the different kinds of art that I create. If you want to read more about my work on Fedora Badges you can visit my wordpress blog.

Engage women, have fun, get more out of your open source project

There are few women developers and even proportionately less working in open source communities. However, a career in OSS is ideal for women who are seeking balance in their lives whether the balance is starting a family or maintaining balance with friends and a strenuous and engaging hobby. It’s well established that there’s a shortage of women pursuing careers in computer science. UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute found that "The fraction of women among bachelor’s graduates in CS increased to 12.9 percent in 2011-12, compared to 11.7 percent in 2010-11." As few as 1.5% of open source contributors are women.
What’s also puzzling is that the rate of women leaving profession software engineering is higher than in law and medical fields. The leave rate of women from software development can’t be adequately explained by it being a taxing field; it isn’t more taxing than law or medicine. There isn’t yet a satisfying explanation for why women leave software engineering. Open source software (OSS), in spite of the lack of women, is a good place to hone ones’ skills and keep skills sharp and relevant even if one doesn’t want to work full time at a software company.
Open source development is social by its nature: a community develops the software. Well-run projects encourage strong communications channels, bring geographically disparate people together into a unified team working toward a common objective, provide resources for collaboration, and create a welcoming environment. Those are all essential community mechanics. Some projects also have aspirations of social good. CodeMontage is a non-profit organization that works hard to bring more people into the open source community and makes contributions to non-profit and humanitarian causes. It is also excels at applying beginner’s talents to projects. Girl Develop It is an international educational program that helps women learn to code. It focuses on networking and keeps women involved in its community in many awesome ways, including mentoring, which is crucial for retaining women in the workplace. These projects, along with taking part in for-profit open source projects, can help a developer maintain visibility in the workplace effectively without requiring that a developer engage on a 40-hour-a-week basis.
The OSS community structure inherently provides enormous flexibility so that individuals can determine the time and extent of their contributions. In theory, there should be even more women engaged in open source development as opposed to the enterprise, because there is less dictating of one's schedule by an outside party.
Open source jobs bring balance
If anything, women working in OSS have more balance than those in law or medicine. In open source, I think it's easier to have kids and still take time to contribute to projects. You can take time out to travel. You can take time out to devote yourself to hobbies, whether it’s pursuing a challenging academic project or learning to climb. It’s possible to keep your skills sharp and also take care of raising kids. From what I've seen, many women who do work in OSS have balanced lives, happy relationships, and rich social lives. It’s an appealing model for women to shape their lives.
Women can pursue a career in open source software engineering at any stage in their lives—from college to mid-career and beyond. As mentioned, there’s room for beginners in many open source projects, and some, such as the Drupal community are very adept at onboarding people who have no prior OSS experience. The annual Python convention now offers childcare, which is rare among non-open source technical conferences.
When I was working as a Senior Vice President at AOL, a woman once walked with me to the train to chat about how to manage her career. She said that until she’d met me she didn’t know that it was possible to be a technical executive and also be a mom. She had ruled out having kids in order to advance her career in technology. That floored me, because the perception is incorrect. Being in OSS techand having kids is great.
Everybody wins
When fewer than 2% of commits are coming from women, strong contributors are being left on the sidelines. Many project leaders care about the issue of gender balance intellectually, but overlook the real impact of failing to attract women to their projects. Projects have broad access to swaths of male engineers with varying degrees of talent; the best engineers could be the women that are being left off of the table. By not engaging women in open source projects teams are leaving 20% of professional developers unengaged. You can’t assure yourself that you’ve attracted the best engineering talent to your project if you’re looking at having less than a handful of women contributing.
Having more women engage in open source projects makes it easier to surface all the available talent in the pool. It also makes it more fun for the other women considering contributions.
It’s more fun to go to Pycon when you know that the Pyladies are sponsoring a mani-pedi offsite. It’s easier to find out what’s going on in the Drupal community when someone like Angela Byron is reaching out a hand and making everyone feel welcome. Ponying up and contributing talents to CodeMontage is just all around better when Vanessa Hurst is meeting you halfway with a smile. Getting more women engaged in open source means that it’s better for the women contributing and results in more engaged committers contributing code. At the end of the day, you just want the best projects and the best code you can get, and having more engaged women is part of getting there.

# Let your code speak for you

There are rapidly growing feature set, high commit rates, and code contributions happening across the globe to Apache Hadoop and related Apache Software Foundation projects. However, the number of woman developers, committers, and Project Management Committee (PMC) members in this vast and diversified ecosystem are really diminutive. For the Hadoop project alone, only 5% out of 84 committers are women; and this has been the case for over the past 2 years.
Due to the exponential rise in adoption, a number of Apache projects such as Apache Pig, Apache Hive, Apache Ambari, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Hbase, etc. have come into existence to augment the Hadoop platform and a lot of new Apache incubator projects such as Apache Storm, Apache Tez, and Apache Knox are currently taking shape in the big data space.  Lets take a look at the number of woman committers and PMC members in some of the projects in the Hadoop ecosystem, both top level and incubator.
From this data, it is evident that there are very few woman committers and PMC members in these projects.
When I joined Hortonworks, a leading commercial vendor of Apache Hadoop that focuses on the development and support of Apache Hadoop, as part of the 24 engineers group from Yahoo! back in 2011, I was the only woman employee in Research and Development and remained so for a very long time.
At Hortonworks, I build large, distributed testing frameworks to guarantee high-quality releases of a unified Hadoop stack. Being a collection of open source projects—each with a different release frequency, rich feature set, and rapid evolution—made testing the Hadoop ecosystem a daunting task. Because of the high influx of code, it becomes imperative to stay updated about new features, API changes, improvements, and the impact every change has on the stack. Validating every component involves a large multi-dimensional matrix of tens of operating systems, multitudes of Java Development Kits (JDKs) and versions, different flavors of database interactions, and various modes like secure, non-secure, etc. The nature of code I write includes thousands of tests running for days on clusters spanning nearly a thousand nodes, crunching terabytes of data, and validating more than a dozen projects.
All of this is critical in achieving stable, high-quality Hadoop stack releases. It is a great feeling to know that you are working for the betterment of a software product, which the industry is so graciously embracing. However, when it came to hiring engineers, it was a hard and long process. Moreover, I constantly faced the challenge of hiring a woman engineer with knowledge of distributed systems and open source experience. During conferences, user group meetings, and in the open source community too, I found a very small percentage of women participants. But in all this, not once did I feel left out of the group because the community was ever welcoming and supportive.
Whether I am reporting a bug, submitting code for review, or '+1ing' a patch or committing the code, there is no bias or double standard. All I see is a vibrant community who is passionate about what they do and striving for excellence. The developer community is brilliant, fair, and has made working on open source software fun and easy.
So, how does one start contributing to an open source project?
The straightforward way is the one I chose: join a company that has a strong commitment to open source software. It is a dream come true for anyone who wants to make a living contributing to open source projects. Conferences like ApacheCon, OSCON, and FOSSCON can help streamline the projects you are interested in. 
Another easy way is by joining a project during its inception stages. The volume of code is less and you get involved in the architectural design and development of the product right from the beginning. For a well-established project, once the code grows and the project is sizable, it wont be easy, at least at first. But you can start with reporting a bug or a documentation issue or by testing a feature or by giving feedback on the usability. You can work your way up by understanding the use cases, overview of the product, architectural details, and then the innards of the code. Source documentation, mailing lists, IRC, online forums, blogs, bug tracking systems, and books prove very helpful in this task. You can then work on submitting a patch for either an improvement you would like to see or for an existing bug. Once your patch is ready for review, you can welcome co-developers to critique your work and get immediate feedback.
After multiple such iterations, your code is ready to be committed to the source code! With a single patch you have already raised your standards. And there is an added benefit of showcasing your work and proving your competence. Your code, responses on mailing list, and review comments establishes your meritocracy in the industry.
I personally am a big believer in innovation through open source development. Working in open source project is both fun and challenging. You get to interact with the best minds in industry, while all striving to build world-class software. Through constant feedback from co-developers in the open source community and due to ideas being discussed openly, its guaranteed that you will be building the best of technology. There is an unrivaled potential for personal growth and it is important for more and more developers, especially women, to participate in the development of open source software.

Let your code speak for itself, and for you.
Advice from 5 Joomla! project leaders: Part 1
By Joomla! (originally published January 2014)
The Joomla! community, inside and outside the company, is diverse and multi-cultural. It is made up of all sorts of people with two things in common: a love for Joomla! and a willingness to reach out and help others on the other side of the keyboard.
The Joomla! project leadership team is comprised of volunteers who are equally as diverse as the community they represent.
So, what makes a good leader at Joomla? Everyone on the leadership team has "been there and done that," and like any great open source project, they have piles of T-shirts to prove it. Here we highlight some of the many women leaders on the Joomla! team. They are inspiring and have unique insights into the community.
Ruth Cheesley
Leadership role (current): Community Leadership Team (2013-present), Joomla!Day UK Organiser (2010-present)
Area contributing to: I’m the liaison on the Joomla User Groups team, reaching out and supporting local user groups. I am also on the Marketing Working Group which is involved with providing marketing support to all areas of the project.
I co-lead Joomla! Day UK and Joomla User Group Suffolk, write for the Joomla Community Magazine, and try to contribute to the documentation as much as I can!  
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
I probably learned the most about myself and my ability to lead from Thomas & Penny Power’s Ecademy, the first online business networking platform, and the amazing contacts I made through being a part of it helped create the conditions in which I felt confident to have my voice heard. Yes, believe it or not, there was a time I was quiet! My business mentor Ian Perry has since taught me a lot about leadership in business, he keeps me on the straight and narrow and isn’t afraid to tell me off! I’m personally supported immensely by my Buddhist teachers and my long-standing partner John.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Keep your inspiration alive, learn how to listen, and leave your personal agendas at the door. I’m still working on all of these!  
It’s really important as a leader that you keep your inspiration alive. Sometimes you will have to make difficult decisions or face challenging situations, and in these moments it’s important to remember what inspires you, what drives you, and what you aspire to.
Listen all the time. And ask for clarification politely and patiently when you need to. Listen with open ears, not with ears that only hear what you want to hear. Expect to be challenged!
Personal agendas will always be there, but in a leadership role you have to learn to side-step them and look at the situation in hand from an objective perspective.
Finally, have somebody who can mentor and support you. Every leader needs a teacher, no matter how high up the chain you are. There will always be times when you need to talk something through with another person and sometimes to blow off steam, and there will always be lessons and skills to be learned. It’s easy to put yourself beyond reproach too, and sometimes you need to be nudged back into line!
What is something surprising about your life?
I originally wanted to be a Marine Engineering Officer in the Navy, then I decided to change career path during A-Levels and trained as a sport scientist, going on to get my masters degree in Physiotherapy!
I have always tinkered with computers, and when I graduated I wasn’t able to get a job in Physiotherapy, so I applied for some IT temp work—quite literally blagging my way about my ability to communicate and good technical knowledge, having worked on the Computer Services helpdesk and tinkered with Joomla while at university. I spent some time as an IT technician in a school, and then as a Data Analyst for the National Health Service working in Infection Control. I eventually left due to health reasons to start my own business.
Dianne Henning
Leadership role (current): JCM co-lead Editor (May 2010-present), JWC 2013 and 2014 Team, JoomlaDay Boston Organizer, and JoomStew.com co-host
Area contributing to: Joomla! Community Magazine as the co-lead Editor with Alice Grevet, The Joomla! Events Team, The Joomla! World Conference 2014 Team (November 7-9, 2014), JoomlaDay Boston (March 15-16, 2014)
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
This is easy. My very good friend, Alice Grevet. We met at the American University in Paris back in 2001 in a Website Design and Management course and have been friends ever since. We have worked together in our professional lives and we have served together with a few non-profit organizations, volunteering our time and learning along the way. Alice has a thoughtful way of leading, she is mindful of the issues and outcome involved, as well as the people who contribute to the process, and she thinks through her responses and actions. Alice has a way of keeping things both professional, and human. She inspires me in so many ways. She also taught me how to knit.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Stay focused on your goals and grow a thick skin. Not everyone is going to like your idea(s), but they asked you to be on a leadership team for a reason. Learn to listen, and learn to know when to let go of something. Being right may not always be the best solution. Engage others in your discussions and thought processes. Sometimes the best advice or idea comes from the most unlikely places. Lastly, enjoy yourself. Anything done as a volunteer should bring you joy and a sense of accomplishment.
What is something surprising about your life?
Life is unpredictable. I worked for an airline for 10 years and flew around the world. I landed in Paris in 1992 with my French husband and 10-month old son. I never thought I would have lived in a foreign country, especially for so long (France for 20 years). And once there, I never thought I would move back to the US and start over after the age of 50. This rentrée has been the best part of my life: I have had the opportunity to do things the way I want to, and I am still in transition mode. Transition is good. It allows for experimenting and making mistakes and learning from them without regret.
Chiara Aliotta
Leadership role (current): Brand Manager at Joomla! since January 2014
Area contributing to: I am an Italian graphic and web designer. Last year, I founded my own creative agency: Until Sunday. And, as of last month, I am actively involved in the Joomla! project as a Brand Manager. It is a wonderful chance to contribute my skills to this active community.
However, I have been designing templates for Joomla! since 2009 when I was working as a web designer for Joomlaworks/Nuevvo. Today, as a freelancer, I design creative and functional Joomla! templates for my Joomla! clients and Joomlashack, a well-known template provider. Since the first edition, I have been involved in the development of the identity and communication materials of J and Beyond, an international Joomla! conference that gathers people from all around the world.
I also attend and speak at different Joomla! conferences, spreading my love for typography and good design throughout the Joomla! community.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
I have a mentor, Paolo Giorgi, art director at Boutique Creativa, Milano. He taught me how to be confident with my creativity, inspire other people, and get inspired. But mostly, he taught me not to hide my passion for my work. Ever.
Another person is my boyfriend who supports me in every single step, encouraging me to be entrepreneurial  and determined.
Of course, I also have some "big names" that I admire and hold up as examples in my everyday life:
Ray Eames, an American designer that worked with her husband contributing to change the "face" of the modern design.
Marissa Mayes, CEO of Yahoo! and one of the first female engineers at Google back in 1999.
Temple Grandin, a person that I immensely admire for overcoming her limits of being an autistic person and a woman, and who today has been listed among the 100 most influential people in the world, actively involved in autism rights and in animal welfare.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
I am quite new to the role of leadership, but as Junior Art Director at Boutique Creativa I was always leading projects and dealing with clients. As a creative person in a team of technicians, your ideas can be easily diminished. So I say to myself and to everybody in a similar position: "Never give up!" Walt Disney was also refused and his ideas were trashed before he founded what is today the Disney colossus!
Before you speak, learn how to listen. Analyze the situation and give others a chance to express their opinion without the fear of being judged. As a leader, you will be expected to make a lot of decisions: embrace them as an opportunity and don’t fear failure. Most of all, love what you do, have lots of enthusiasm, and be inspiring. The team you lead must love working with you!
What is something surprising about your life?
Since I was child I knew I was going to work for something that would always amuse me. My first editorial design was in collaboration with my brother when we were both really small: the magazine was just for my parents (limited edition, as you may understand) and it was entirely handmade using glue and cut out from other magazines and our drawings.
Before studying Design and Communication, I was an industrial designer and passionate about designing furniture and objects for children. What made me change my mind about my future career was the day that I got in the wrong class and Massimo Pitis, at the time teacher of Communication Design at Politecnico of Milan, was giving a lesson about the history of graphic design. A few years later, I completed my final degree in Communication Design, with full marks with Massimo Pitis as my tutor.
I play the clarinet from the age of 9, and I also took part in various singing competitions as a child. My teenage, secret dream was to be the front-woman in a rock band and sing like Alanis Morissette.
Alice Grevet
Leadership role (current): Secretary, Board of Open Source Matters, Inc. (board member since Oct. 2010-present); Joomla Community Magazine co-lead editor with Dianne Henning (JCM team member since May 2010-present).
Area contributing to: Open Source Matters (OSM) provides the legal and financial support for the Joomla Open Source project. Our primary responsibilities are to oversee the budget for the project, handle legal issues/questions that arise, and Trademark usage. OSM also manages the areas not covered by the other two project leadership teams (Community Leadership Team (CLT) and Production Leadership Team (PLT), such as operations management, events, the Joomla certification program, marketing, and public relations in addition to brand management and licensing issues.
OSM is geographically diverse. We currently have board members in The Netherlands, South Africa, Germany, Israel, Guatemala, Sweden, the US, and Canada. I am American and I live in France.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
It is difficult to identify one person. I think the seeds for the leadership roles I have held were planted during my teenage years, when I was elected to be a youth advisory delegate to a (US) national assembly, and at about the same time, I served on a search committee to hire a community leader. The adults who shaped those experiences for me were thoughtful, responsible people with good insight into group dynamics and interpersonal relations. There were several, mostly male, and I learned a lot from them. I have a memory of wishing I could be like them when I grew up, but thought I would never be able to have that kind of impact because I was female.
Then I made the unusual decision at age 18 to attend an all-female university. For four years, every class officer, classmate, dorm mate, and most of my companions were female. I was only competing against my own gender set for class participation, and every day I experienced the message of empowerment and encouragement, strongly communicated by the college, that women can do anything. I have never doubted it since.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Depending on the area of leadership, achieving certain goals in an organization with a complex structure can take time. Whether female or male, my advice is the same: be patient, try to be a person others will want to work with, and keep plugging away. Don’t let disagreements get personal. Invariably people who end up in leadership positions at Joomla have the common story of loving the Joomla community and this wonderful software that has changed our lives. Keep that sentiment foremost in your mind. Taking on a leadership role is a lot of work, and also very rewarding.
What is surprising about your life?
At age five, I started a long history of music lessons, finally settling on the harp. A six-foot concert harp stands my living room.
I have two children, and I am equally proud of both, but most relevant to this article is my daughter who is pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science (specifically Human and Computer Interaction), and her research and career are going to help define the future of the Internet. At the same time she is blazing a trail in a highly male-dominated field, and will be an inspiration to this and future generations of women.
Tessa Mero
Leadership role (current): Joomla! Extensions Directory Listing Manager (December 2013-present), Joomla! User Group Seattle Organizer (January 2014-present)
Area contributing to: I am currently working as the listing manager for the Joomla! Extensions Directory that is managed under Matthew Baylor. Working with a small team of listing editors, I am in charge of training new team members on the listing process and also with the approval process of all listings being submitted to the Joomla! Extensions Directory. We have also been responsible for writing the new Terms of Service agreement and the Requirements Document for the new JED 3.0. We’ve recently went through an applicant pile and selected a developer to build the new system. Our next big project is migrating the JED from 1.5 to the latest Joomla version, which will be a major stepping stone for our community.
I’ve also just recently stepped up as organizer for the Joomla! User Group of Seattle, currently holding a total of 94 members in the meetup group.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
My first influence in the community has been OSTraining.com, who I previously worked for with Joomla! training, writing tutorials, and helping debug websites. They have taught me so much and introduced me to being an open source contributor. I wouldn’t have known how to be involved if it wasn’t for them.
My second influence is Gary Brooks, who is CEO of Cloudaccess.net. I met him during my first Joomla! conference in New York City back in 2011 when I just started out working as a developer and using Joomla! He was responsible for introducing me to everyone in the community and always telling me he sees a lot of potential in me and believes I will become a future leader.
Lastly, the entire community has been a big influence on me. Everyone works so hard and does a great job making Joomla! an amazing CMS. I love you all!
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
The best advice I can give to someone is don’t be shy and ask questions if you need help. Always believe you can do it. You are truly capable of anything if you put your heart into it. Be involved with things you are interested in, not to just "be involved." If you want to become a leader, put yourself out there and speak up. If you wait around for things to happen or people to offer you something, you will be waiting for a long time. Treat everyone with respect and don’t be involved in drama. Speak your opinions wisely. If you are a female, don’t feel that you are different from everyone else, because we are all equally just as awesome. Gender should never be a barrier. Don’t underestimate your skills and believe you are greater than you really are. Be ambitious and reach towards goals that seem impossible, because it really is possible. Be an inspiration and role model to others. Teach and help others become involved. I can go forever on giving advice, so I’ll stop here!
What is surprising about your life?
My biggest hobby most of my life has been gaming. Mostly PC, some console. It all started when my parents bought me an NES system in 1987, then my dad gave me his hand me down Mac computer in 1993 along with 100 "pirated" games. It was a hobby I took very seriously and was involved in the gaming community, including ladders and tournaments. I recently stopped this hobby to concentrate on raising my children and growing in my career. I will definitely learn to make time again for this!
I love playing my clarinet and making music. I was in the International Music Ensemble club while in college, which wasn’t too long ago. When I was a teenager I use to go to WBIC every year, which is an international musician conference where the best musicians in every high school gets together and have a week to practice their music and create a CD of classical music. Oh, good memories!

Advice from 5 Joomla! project leaders: Part 2
By Joomla! (originally published February 2014)
Last week, five Joomla! project leaders shared insights into their roles and advice for how to be a great leader in an open source community.
Here, we share with you five more leaders in open source sharing wisdom and advice for men and women interested in learning more about how to have a successful career in open source.
Sarah Watz
Leadership role (current): Board Member of Open Source Matters, Inc. (October 2012-present); President of the Joomla! User Association Sweden (November 2008-March 2012); Vice President of the Joomla! User Association Sweden (November 2007-November 2008); Joomla! Day Sweden Organizer and Joomla! Night Sweden Organizer
Area contributing to: In my role as a board member I work with the other board members with the responsibility for budget, legal issues, trademark usage, events, marketing, public relations etc. I also work with a great team to make the Joomla Certification Program come alive.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
My husband Peter that is my partner in life and business that always makes sure that I don’t lose my edge. My kids Kate (12 years old) and Philip (10 years old) always let’s me look at the world through their eyes to see their way of learning and exploring. My dad, who is no longer among us, always encouraged me to step up and lead. He made sure that I got the confidence to try and fail. And then get up again trying again and finding new ways to succeed. My mom always has my back and makes sure that I’m grounded and seeing things like they are. My team at my digital agency Pixpro enthusiastically inspires me to the great things a team can do when working together with people that have different backgrounds, experiences, and knowledge. The, great things can not be prevented to happen.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Listen first. Be humble to the differences in how to tackle things and be sure to embrace the difference. Your opinion/experience/voice matters so speak up. Even if things have been done a certain way before you, joining a leadership position doesn’t mean that they have to stay that way. Don’t be afraid of change. If we don’t progress we slowly die.
What is something surprising about your life?
I love scrapbooking and quilting.
Marijke Stuivenberg
Leadership role (current): Assistant Secretary Board of Open Source Matters, Inc. (October 2010-present); Secretary Stichting Sympathy (Dutch foundation that supports Joomla in the Netherlands, January-present); Manager and co-founder Dutch Joomla Community JoomlaCommunity.eu (October 2008-present); Leader Dutch Translation Team (2007-present), Coordinator Joomla Translation Teams (September 2009-present)
Area contributing to: I started contributing to Joomla by translating the core into Dutch for the Dutch community when Joomla 1.5 was released. When translating software, you have to check if your translation makes sense and you get to use all features including producing errors. By doing so I started to find bugs and was getting annoyed if they weren’t fixed when there was a new release. That’s when I learned that they probably won’t get fixed until you report them at the tracker. After posting and testing bugs I was asked to join the Joomla Bug Squad and started to contribute by helping testing the fixes others provided and learned much from it. In the meantime the Dutch community was up for improvement and together with some others we kind of forked the existing community and founded a new one.
The community and the Dutch JoomlaDays are now operated under the Dutch foundation Stichting Sympathy that I co-founded. I also contribute and help organizing the Dutch JoomlaDays who has a very good reputation in the international Joomla Community. This Dutch community cares about contributing and collaborating with the international project. The Dutch translation of Joomla core got accredited and I joined the Joomla Translation Team. That team exists of translators from over the whole world that translate Joomla core. Shortly after joining that team, I was asked to also help coordinate the team.
The Coordination Translation Team helps new translators to set up their translation the proper way, informs all the Translation Teams of upcoming releases, new strings to be translated and provide the means to distribute these translations. I always feel that if there is an area where you can truly experience the barriers of languages, time zones and cultures, that is the one. In 2010 I was nominated for a position on the board of Open Source Matters. Open Source Matters provides the organizational, legal, and financial support for the Joomla! open source project. Internationalization has been one of the main areas that I have been working on and interested in to get (high) on the agenda since I was elected on the board.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
I think it is impossible to name one person. Every person in your life is your teacher, even your worst enemy. I have wondered why I end up often in leadership roles though. And I came to the conclusion that my parents, the way they brought me up and especially my mother has been a great role model for me. My mother didn’t have the chance to have the education I did, but that didn’t keep her from stepping up and taking on leadership positions when she was passionate about the cause. She never stopped learning, and I guess she was my inspiration to not be afraid of speaking up my mind and showed me that you can never know everything, but you are able to learn, especially from your mistakes and by listening to other people around you.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Be passionate about your tasks but don't let your emotions lead you.
Never take on a leadership role for gaining personal status, it will tear you down at the end.
Listen to others but don't be afraid to speak up and share your own thoughts. After all, the leaders you work with are a bunch of people that look at things from all kind of different angles. Sometimes you have to step a few passes away and take your time to look at the problem you are trying to solve from a bigger distance to be able to see it from more than only your own perspective.
Be honest, don’t be afraid to admit you made a mistake or didn’t get to the task you promised to execute. Hiding it is much worse.
Learn and never stop learning!
What is surprising about your life?
I don’t do any professional business with Joomla (yet). I’m a professionally educated musician; I play the Saxophone. Not jazz, though I am passionate about it too. What you probably didn’t know is that the Saxophone is a classical instrument too, and that's the kind of music I play.
I teach about 50 students a week how to play the Saxophone at a music school in my area. When I studied how to play the Saxophone at the conservatory, I was the only female student. I played in a Big Band for years as the only female. Now most of my students are female and I’m always glad when a new male student applies! Yes, things can definitely change according gender.
It is amazing to experience how Joomla and my history as a musician come together in so many areas. Lots of time I use my experience in music within the Joomla project and vice versa. I’m passionate about open source and the accessibility of software for people all over the world, and I feel the same about being able to learn and let music be a part of your life.
Claire Mandville
Leadership role (current): I am the Vulnerable Extensions List (VEL) Manager in charge of a small team who reacts to and informs on all the vulnerable extension list items. I work closely with the Joomla Extensions Developers (JED) dealing with resolutions from developers.
Area contributing to: I also liaise with the Joomla Security Strike Team (JSST) dealing with the incoming reports and queries on Joomla core security.
I co-moderate the Joomla security forums for all versions.
I previously worked on the trademark and licensing team as the domain keeper; dealing with the incoming registrations and advising of any requirements to be met.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
I would honestly say "the Joomla community". There are so many different angles, attitudes, ideas and it is the main feeder for direction suggestions.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Learn the rules. As a leader you are expected to enforce any rules, so try and do that fairly until you have listened to your team learning what does and doesn't work and then look at how it can be fixed. Try and be firm but fair, take each challenge as they come, be diplomatic with any delegation you do.
What is surprising about your life?
I speak English, Irish, and Quebecois. I used to play flageolet and bodhran. I dont have a passport. I hacked my first computer network circa 1984 at school (EcoNet). I train Neighborhood Renewal areas in ICT. And, I hold physical security licenses and am also licensed to drive type A,B,C and D/ D1 vehicles in Europe.
Andrea Tarr
Leadership role (current): Co-manager of Joomla User Group New England (2011-present)
Area contributing to:
My recent yet past leadership roles were: Production Leadership Team (June 2011-June 2013), Board Member Open Source Matters, Inc. (October 2010-June 2011), JoomlaDay New England co-organizer (2009-2013).
I got involved with Joomla through the Joomla User Group New England and helped co-ordinate the first JoomlaDay New England. I contributed to the project as part of the Google Summer of Code 2009 when I wrote the accessible administrator template Hathor for Joomla 1.6. From there I joined the Joomla Bug Squad and started talking at various Joomla Days. When I was on the Production Leadership Team, I focused on closer ties with the development community at large and getting developers involved in the Joomla roadmap and working groups.
Who has contributed to your leadership skills over the years?
My parents. They just assumed that I was capable of doing anything I wanted and that it was perfectly natural that I had a passion for mathematics. I started tutoring other students while I was still in elementary school because I could see they wanted help and it was something I could do. I tend to assume leadership roles when there's a vacuum that needs filling rather than actively seeking them out.
What is your advice to someone new to a leadership position?
Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Really listen to what people are saying, notice what they are actually doing and make decisions.
What is surprising about your life?
I was 8th in the USA rankings in Women's C-1 whitewater slalom racing in 2000. There's a funny story behind that, so ask me about it when we meet at a conference sometime. I have, at one point or another in my life, played flute, guitar, soprano recorder, alto recorder, mandolin, mountain dulcimer, hammered dulcimer, and concertina. I belong to two dance groups, as dancer, teacher and choreographer. I took my notes in college in the Anglo Saxon script, I am a former librarian, and live with my cats. Oh, yes, and I knit, too.

Get more eyeballs: 5 steps to using design in your open source project
By Georgia Bullen (originally published February 2014)
At the Open Technology Institute (OTI), we've been working on opening our user feedback process as a way to improve our internal processes and collaboration, engage our user community more, promote non-developer contributions, and think more broadly about how open source process plays a role in the Commotion Wireless project, a free and open source communication tool that uses mobile phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized mesh networks.
More on that in my previous article.
In this article, I've expanded on the five tips I've identified for leveraging user-centered design in your open source project.
1. Track usability and design issues.
Gather context as well as feedback
Don't respond (with software/design changes) to each piece of feedback
Synthesize issues for themes
As a result of our field activities, we had a pretty large queue of feedback from trainers, trainees, and users on documentation, usability and design, feedback from hackathons, the developer and discussion mailing lists, as well as a tracker for issues that people submit via the website. Given the amount of feedback we had gathered over the last few years, we decided to start by synthesizing and categorizing the themes in that dataset.
Understanding user feedback can be very challenging. Many developers and designers hear feedback or read notes from a user feedback session, and want to make changes to the user interface based on each comment a user makes. What a user says exactly is not always the change that you need to make—it's important to understand the context in which the user provided the feedback. We've run into this a few times on the Commotion project, as much of our feedback comes from hands-on training sessions with novice users.
The main problem here is that it becomes difficult to understand if the feedback is on the documentation that the user is following, something confusing in the interface design or a mismatch between the documentation and the interface. Understanding the context and the user motivations and goals, and documenting that with the actual feedback—observational or commentary—is crucial for assessing the feedback later. Not to mention that it makes it possible for other team members to understand the context without having been present.
2. Understand who you want to design for.
When making design decisions, you often have to prioritize which type of user to design for—novice or expert users. Our goal with the Commotion project is that anyone should be able to set up a mesh network, which would push us in the direction of designing for novice users.
The challenge is that in network administration and management, users will frequently and sometimes very quickly need access to the more advanced settings and configuration tools. Striking the balance between novice usability and expert access can be challenging, and it's important here to remember that each round of usability improvements is just that - the current round or iteration. You might not be able to fix everything this time, and you might not have even found all of the issues to fix.
The important thing is that you focus on keeping it simple and learnable to allow novice users to find their way around and expert users the ability or doors to get to the features they know they need.
3. Make prototypes.
Leverage the style of the prototype (low-fidelity vs high-fidelity) to get the type of feedback you need.
 Similar to the issue I described earlier about understanding the context surrounding the user feedback, it's important to understand the context you are creating with your prototypes. High-fidelity prototypes or mockups are a great way to get detailed design/visual feedback from users—e.g. about colors, language, placement of buttons, etc. High-fidelity prototypes are not a good way to get feedback about the logical process flow—e.g. does your software match users' mental models of how the software should work?
The basic rule of thumb here is that the sketchier (literally more sketch-like) your prototypes are—the more likely the feedback will be about information structure and process flow—i.e. challenging your basic design assumptions, whereas the more detailed the prototypes are the less likely the user is to challenge it because they have a sense that you've already finished and so focus on the aesthetic issues. The type of prototype you make should be based on the type of feedback that you need.
4. Understand how the software works from the user's perspective.
The next step of the process for us was to reach out to user groups—some whom we had trained and some who had adopted the software on their own to have them do a walkthrough of the prototypes. We looked for novice users as well as expert users to make sure that the changes we were making wouldn't break anyone's mental models of the software and to make sure that we were burying any tools that needed to be top level in the interface. We scheduled as many users as we had time to work with, and used screen sharing software to walk through some standard tasks using Commotion.
To do this, we prepared a plan for our interactions with the user community, asking them to Think Aloud through some of the common tasks such as configuring a wireless router, checking on the network status, finding out how many users are currently connected, and things like that. We also had some standard "demographic" questions to get a sense of the user's context, such as their familiarity with the software and with managing networks, what type of network they were involved in, their role within the network, and what type of operating systems and technology they use most often. All of this information can help your team in building better user profiles or personas and can feed into more informed design processes for new features down the line.
5. Use usability/design iterations to build your community: hackathons, mailing lists, and distributed tools.
Similar to what the Magnolia CMS team described in their post about designing for mobile versus desktop, it’s important to be open and transparent about the usability review and design process as it can help you engage your broader community. This means cultivating conversations on mailing lists, encouraging constructive criticism of UX and design, or even asking current members to recruit others that work in UX to the project.
For the Commotion team, this was just one iteration of what has been and will continue to be many improvements to the user interface, but it gave us a chance to practice our process, catch up on a backlog of user interface issues, and work on developing our community. It also gave us an opportunity to show the community the many ways that they contribute to the process, aside from just contributing code. We’re making sure that whenever we go to a hackathon, we have our documentation ready to be hacked on along side our software, website, and everything else, so that we can keep making it better and easier to use.

The Women of OpenStack talk outreach, education, and mentoring
By Anne Gentle (originally published February 2014)
In the open source world, a women-only event seems counter-intuitive. Yet I am finding reasons for such events the more I attend them.
At the OpenStack Summit, a twice-a-year event where OpenStack contributors get together to plan the next release, the Women of OpenStack group has set up events where we invite the women first. Men aren't excluded, but our hope is to get more OpenStack women together. I can hardly capture the value of getting together with other women in OpenStack at the Summit, but here goes.
Why do we get together apart from the rest of the conference?
We have a couple of themes for our meetups. We talk about outreach to more women, especially in education as early as elementary school and definitely through college. Also, we meet our GNOME Outreach Program for Women interns in person for the first time! That’s a huge reason for these in-person gatherings: getting to know each other personally. But we also want to find concrete ways to make our meetings meaningful, so we talk about a few tracks for our goals: outreach, education, career planning, and mentoring. We come up with ideas for our goals, and we keep discussing them at each Summit. It’s like a design summit session for women of OpenStack. And, in between Summits we stay in touch via LinkedIn.
We look for speaking opportunities for women in the cloud. We have held workshops geared towards outreach to women, introducing lots of technical women to OpenStack. For example, this past year Iccha Sethi, Jessica Lucci, and I ran a workshop at the Grace Hopper Open Source Day, and Anita Kuno, Lyz Krumbach Joseph, and Ryan Lane ran a CodeChix workshop. We generallyforge the bonds that hold together a common minority by talking about schools, parenting, gin as a vegetable, shoes, traveling wardrobes, and how does this OpenStack Neutron plug-in work, anyway?
We get to know each other. I sat down across from a woman who mentioned she works at IBM in Austin. I said, "Oh, I work at Rackspace in Austin." She said, "Where do you live?" I said, "Oh, in northwest Austin." She said, "Wait, where do you live!?" As it turns out, we both have fourth graders who go to the same neighborhood school! It’s a small world with tight connections in Austin for high-tech women. It seems impossible with the numbers game we’d know each other’s schools, streets, neighborhoods, and so on, but in reality we’re rare enough birds of a feather that it is natural for us to get together and get know each other well. We can talk about families, parenting, all in a technology setting, without any concerns for: "Is it okay to talk about this here?" We are glad to share. There are so few of us that we need to be diligent about our outreach and staying connected.
This year we had a question at the OpenStack Summit related to under representation of minorities in a panel with the OpenStack Technical Committee. I couldn't quite gather my thoughts to talk about it on the panel, but I blogged about it later because it's vitally important as we grow as a community. We need to be hyper-vigilant about impostor syndrome, uncovered by researchers who found that many high-achieving females believe they are not intelligent and that others over-evaluate them. Believe me, I have to fake it to make it daily. This is part of the reality of questioning whether you belong in open source, whether you have leadership potential, and whether you have the technical chops.
Our culture as a community may reward the most confident, but in reality as we grow as a community it’s important to understand that some cultures do not view confidence in the same way, and some people do not naturally exude confidence. We’re also looking at English-as-a-second-language (ESL) increasing in prevalence in our community, and a former Outreach Program for Women intern, Anita Kuno, recently edited our Technical Committee charter to be gender-neutral. These efforts matter. These gatherings give us a chance to question the normal in a safe arena. We are also able to track numbers of women attending OpenStack Summits. We won't know if we're improving if we don't track it, and we can't improve if we don't start somewhere.
The best way I can think to describe why it matters for women to network with other women is there's an establishment of trust, that this community is also your community. We don't tend to walk into a room full of all-women in open source events. More often you walk into a room, try to figure out just where to sit, try to find someone else you recognize and can talk to, and see if you know any regulars from other areas. With small networks of women in open source, my vision is that we'll walk into the room and just know we belong. Then we won't ask questions like: "How can we get more women in open source?" We'll ask: "How can we get more people in open source?"

Golden opportunity for public libraries to meet digital needs of women
By Carolyn Fox (originally published January 2014)
Women use the Internet 17% more than their male counterparts yet are underrepresented in programming and open source. Public libraries (and public schools) have a critical role to play with improving the dearth of diversity in coding and open source.
Over the holidays, I completely lost my unlimited home Internet access, which caused me to reflect on life for those without unlimited home Internet access at all. When I finally had my Internet access restored and retrieved the messages about Opensource.com's Youth in Open Source Week (was held January 13- 17) and Women in Open Source Week (this week, January 27 - February 7), I felt like banging my head.
Without unlimited home Internet access, there's no question that women and youth are hampered to code or participate in open source. And for many, unlimited home Internet access is simply unaffordable. Globally, the Internet has become a lifeline for women. Yet access is still inequitable and a digital divide looms large globally and in the US. Here in the US, Internet access is often slow, costly, and unfair.
The cost of Internet access is a huge barrier for female-headed households. Many single mothers struggle to put food on the table, never mind paying for Internet access. Moreover, with 47 million Americans receiving food assistance, single mothers comprise the bulk of them; these single mothers, in turn, feed their children with that food assistance for some food security. However, these single mothers are often in stagnant low-wage jobs and have little to no disposable income to pay for Internet access. Unlimited home Internet access then soon becomes a pipe dream. And open educational resources and opportunities for them and their children become inaccessible.
Public Internet access, of some form, is available at nearly every public library in the US. Over 90% of public libraries in the US provide free WiFi services. Over 64% of public libraries report being theonly free provider of Internet access in their community. In over 87% of urban communities, the demand for computers outstrips the number of computers for public use.
Staggeringly, public libraries serve over 96.4% of the US population. The majority of library programs deservedly serve children. And while demand for library programs has spiraled up, so has the need for public computer access and digital technology.
Public libraries, though, often place restrictions on the use of their computer workstations and accessibility, and these restrictions may have a profound effect on the ability of women and/or youth to learn to code or become involved in open source. At my local library, for instance, there are six desktop computers for children to use and there are restrictions on their use. Among the restrictions, children are guaranteed only 30 minutes of total computer time per day. And that seems to be the standard policy at neighboring local public libraries as well.
When I was in library school, I had to learn HTML and CSS and needed much time to do so. If there had been a time limit to my Internet access to learn HTML and CSS, I wouldn't have gotten far. Most likely, I would have given up such an attempt to learn. And forget about 'real' programming or open source in this discussion. It requires much time, patience, and dedication to write code.
Many public libraries have storytime for toddlers and preschoolers or Legos clubs for older kids, but the idea of programming or open source with kids is alien. There are many opportunities for public libraries to jump on the bandwagon beyond coding though. Even if the public library lacks the funding to provide such open opportunities, they can still make a huge difference by offering meeting rooms or space for eager and motivated kids and/or women to learn about open source or code themselves. There are public libraries welcoming tweens to hold their own Mindcraft clubs using their space; without using any funds from the public libraries and kids usually bring their own computers too.
Public libraries (and public schools) have a critical role to play with improving the dearth of diversity in coding and open source. Georgia Tech's Barbara Ericson recently combed through data on the AP Computer Science 2013 results and reached some alarming conclusions: no females took the exam in Mississippi, Montana, and Wyoming, and eleven states had no black students engage in the exam. The statistics for Hispanics were bleak too. EdSurge has suggested ways for public schools to improve these dismal numbers, but I suggest that public libraries may also look for ways to help improve the dismal numbers as well.
Public libraries may look to their statistics on women to support programs or find ways to play to improve the role of women and youth in coding and open source. Statistically, women, especially working women and working mothers, are significantly more likely than men (72% to 58%) to visit the library. Women are also more likely to have a library card than men. Since women are more likely to enter the public library, here's a golden opportunity for public libraries to serve their unmet digital needs; women use the Internet 17% more than their male counterparts yet are underrepresented in programming and open source. And yet, remember too, women, especially single mothers, are the ones more often bringing their children to the public library; so the rate of return to public libraries and the rate of return to society and open source is magnified.
Perhaps not surprisingly, San Jose Public Library has found a way help girls code and offers a great example. With help from the national nonprofit organization, Girls Who Code, girls in grades 9-12 may learn computer science fundamentals by programming apps and video games. Let's encourage others to jump on board.

What's the best entry point for women in computing? Open source.
By Jen Wike, Interview with Leslie Hawthorn (originally published February 2014)
Leslie Hawthorn is the new community manager at Elastic Search, an open source real time data and analytics company, and a member of the program committee for the Grace Hopper conference that is held each year to increase "visibility for the contributions of women to computing."
Last year the conference celebrated 13 years of bringing together women technologists and welcomed more than 4,750 attendees from 53 different countries, and 350 companies, from around the world. This year, the Grace Hopper conference will be held October 8 - 11 at The Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona. A call for participation has been issued and will conclude on March 14.
I chatted with Leslie last year around this time about the conference, so I caught up with her again to ask how things are going. She was as exuberant as ever about the impact the conference is having on women getting into, staying in, and excelling in technology as well as in open source. In this interview, she tells me more about an event called Open Source Day she's helped put together, and its growing popularity at the conference.
Jen Wike: Leslie, you talked with me a little bit over a year ago in December 2012 about the Grace Hopper conference. This year, for the Opensource.com Women in Open Source Week, I wanted to catch up with you again and talk about Open Source Day at the Grace Hopper conference.
How did this special day came about, and how are you involved?
Leslie Hawthorn: Great to talk with you, Jen. So, Grace Hopper's Open Source Day actually started several years ago, back in 2010. A group of us got together at the conference and we were talking about how much we loved the idea of Grace Hopper creating a conference and community specifically focused on technical women. At the same time we didn't see many offerings in the program related to open source software.
All of us were discussing the growing importance of participating in open source projects, and we thought that this was something that we would love to bring to the conference and share with our fellow attendees. We realized how important it is to help our fellow attendees learn about what open source software is, what open source development is all about, and to have the opportunity to collaborate together to create open source code.
In 2011, we actually scheduled our very first Grace Hopper Open Source Day, which was a full day of people coming together in small groups collaborating to work on a variety of open source software projects that had a social good focus. Folks from the Sahana Software Foundation participated; they develop disaster preparedness strategies and manage a platform to help people who are the victims of natural disasters. They also provide help to the non-governmental organizations who are taking care of those people.
During Grace Hopper 2013 on Open Source Day, we worked on more than 10 open source projects and had more than 250 attendees. Experienced women in tech were there to help teach other women how to do programming for their particular project or to work with them in a mentorship capacity. Each year we find that we fill up in terms of the number of attendees we can handle for the event! And then we have a waiting list. So, if this sounds like something you are excited about doing or you are interested in participating in, sign up for Open Source Day sooner rather than later to make sure that you get a spot.
Jen Wike: When is a good time for people to sign up?
Leslie Hawthorn: Sign up should be up in the next couple of months. They just announced the schedule for Grace Hopper 2014, and the Open Source Day event is organized by a group of volunteers who get together and begin planning slightly after the conference is announced. Keep an eye on the website, and I will also let you know too, so you can help get the word out.
Jen Wike: Yes, we'll share that with our community on Twitter and Facebook!
Tell us about some amazing stories that have come out of the Open Source Day events so far.
Leslie Hawthorn: Absolutely. One of my favorites comes from Open Source Day last year. In typical fashion, we were all getting together and working on some information for one of the participating projects and, of course, something needed to be debugged. Then, something else needed to be debugged.
It turned into a group of five of our mentors sitting around a table with new members to the event, all working to debug this issue. It was such a great experience, because we were able to make progress with these women who were all new to open source and very early on in their careers as developers. These were women who were in their first or second year of an undergraduate degree. Before that day have gotten started, we talked about what they were expecting and what projects they were interested in participating in, and each one of them expressed a certain amount of intimidation because they had just gotten started at the university or they had never worked on open source software before. They thought maybe they weren't as well prepared as they wanted to be.
But, the big goal with Open Source Day is not just to get code written, which is always wonderful, but it's really more about an opportunity to get technical women together and work collaborately on a coding project while also learning about what open source software is. So, I reminded all of the attendees of that, then we all smiled and said that's great, rolled up our sleeves, and got to work.
Jen Wike: Tell us a little more about your specific role with the conference.
Leslie Hawthorn: I often participated on site as a mentor, kind of orienting folks. Now I am doing marketing and public relations from the perspective of getting information on social media, writing for the press, and getting in contact with reporters or other folks who are interested in learning more about Open Source Day. This is for a two-fold purpose. One, to raise awareness of Grace Hopper's Open Source Day among the attendees so that they realize that this is an event that they can come to. And, also to raise awareness in the general media for people who are interested in my writing about women in technology because there are many reporters who are focused on the Grace Hopper conference for just that reason. I help make them aware of and talk about some of the topics around women in open source technology and the importance of open source software.
Jen Wike: You're on the front lines of what it takes to get more women in to open source. Do you feel that most women are getting into programming and computing without familiarity with open source?
Leslie Hawthorn: I do think that in general women are getting into programming without learning about open source. If we look at the mixture of women working as programmers in the overall industry, we we see that ratio is approximately 25% women. So, one in four programmers are women, that's great. If we look at the open source world, depending on which set of academic studies you look at, we see participation between 2% and 8% women; that is substantially less than what we see in the industry.
I think that there are many women who are doing technical work but not the open source way, because it's not required for their job or they simply never thought about it. And then, if you look at women who are just getting started in their programming careers, a lot of folks are extremely intimidated by the idea of open source software because they were warned about it, and because if you compare yourself to the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, you're standard and expectation for yourself is going to be too high for entry.
Jen Wike: If women could get beyond that intimidation, do you think they would find open source projects more appealing than proprietary software projects, in general?
Leslie Hawthorn: I think that what's interesting to me, is that there are so many different open source projects that are specifically focused on humanitarian efforts or on making the world a better place by eliminating the suffering of other people.
Humanitarian efforts are where I focus a lot of my time. I strive to show people that this is software were there is opportunity to make a positive difference in the world, through volunteer work of all kinds and through contributions to code.
What I've seen time and time again throughout my career when talking to women developers, not just open source developers but developers in general, is that working on open source projects also helps them build their portfolios and resumes. These women are also very focused on making sure that what they create is incredibly useful to people. They want to make something they know would make the world a better place or that they know that their family or friends could use.
Open source software provides an immediate connection to the work.
Jen Wike: In the media lately, we've seen a lot of questions arise around getting girls into computer science. How do we reach them? How do we talk to them? Is there a creative aspect to the work that is missing or not well-represented?
Leslie Hawthorn: I think one of the reasons we see less interest on the part of young women in computer science is the fact that as a society when I say to you: "A scientist walked down the street to buy a chemistry set...", what picture do you get in your head? Most likely one of an older man with white hair that looks very dignified, wearing a lab coat. Our cultural influences are the foundation on which we think about who programs. Who is a computer scientist? You might think of Linux Torvalds but not Grace Hopper.
When kids are young, we tend to think that building things is something boys do and caring for people is something girls do. We reinforce those ideas from the start. I think we want more of a mix and to allow girls and boys to do whatever they like. I think we strive to make building things really exciting for everybody and not a gender-specific activity.
I grew up playing with Legos. It was a blast creating a new world and tampering with it—breaking it apart and rebuilding it and getting something new each time. If we want to see young women get excited about technical stuff, we need to give them that same platform and that same permission to want to explore things and see exactly what it is they can create. This starts at home and at school.
Jen Wike: The Maker movement is really picking up speed and we are seeing more open hardware projects and companies start up and find some success. Do you feel like the Maker and DIY movement is a path to giving more people, women especially, that permission you talk about—to tinker with and pull things apart?
Leslie Hawthorn: Absolutely. I watch some of my friends who are moms and dads, and it's very important to them to make sure they are nurturing their daughters to have a sense of wonder with the world; to experiment and tinker and play. I think the traditional way to raise a girl is to urge them not to be lazy, not to make a mess, and not to break anything. But that mentality is about bringing order to chaos. We should be creating order from chaos, or even, we should be creating chaos for the sake of seeing chaos grow into something new and beautiful.
Look at 3D printing. The idea there is that in order to do prototyping for something that's really exciting, we can make it and give to our friends so they can test it out. If it doesn't work the first 500 times, we can toss it and start again until we make something that is convincing and appealing because we're dealing with some plastic filament.
Jen Wike: Leslie, thank you so much for chatting with me today. Your advice and perspective is invaluable and I appreciate you sharing with us during our first Women in Open Source week at Opensource.com.
Leslie Hawthorn: Thanks, Jen!

What I learned while editing Wikipedia
By Noopur Raval (originally published January 2014)
I was introduced to the Wikimedia movement primarily as a communications consultant for Wikimedia Foundation’s first Global South project that began in India in 2011. My work with the Wikimedia Foundation and editing Wikipedia has helped me take a hard look at myself as a woman of colour from India in technology.
After my initial stint with Wikipedia editing, I increasingly realized that the English version of Wikipedia lacked articles on Indian writers, famous personalities, cultural artifacts, and more. The problem is multi-layered and includes poor coverage of everything relating to non-western societies as well as to women within those societies. Once, I created article on Wikipedia about an Indian, female writer named Bama. She is from the lowest caste community called Dalits in India; and while the author is a celebrated writer of stories on the subject of double oppression (which is oppression of women by people of higher castes and oppression by men within their own communities), Wikipedia almost naturally had no record of her work. Sadly, within minutes of my creation of her article it was nominated for deletion. I then quickly added more references while simultaneously starting a discussion about why it should not be deleted. At that point, another Indian editor jumped in and helped with the explanation; the next day the deletion tag was removed.
Similarly, many articles on crafts and oral traditions that we tried to create as a part of our GLAM activity at the National Crafts Museum in Delhi underwent gruesome scrutiny because they were clearly not the usual subjects of Wikipedia additions and editing. This abysmal gap motivated me to start editing almost only just to fill these lacunae. Since then, I’ve also created articles on violence against women and female authors from India. My commitment only grown and gained momentum to do what I see as helping Wikipedia fulfill its mission to be "completely open and free."
The question I ask myself now everyday is whether merely enabling access through infrastructure and providing free platforms like Wikipedia can help us resolve uneven digital geographies created in the process.
As part of the Women in Free Software and Culture in India group, I recently led a hackathon group to edit sexual violence out of Wikipedia. The group is a voluntary organization of women working in free software in India; we have a corresponding mailing list where we share news, have discussions, and organize events. One member of the group is a free software consultant who identifies as transgender. She is trying to educate people about transgender rights, including living and pay conditions, and supports the transgender community by being open about her sexual orientation. About her role and outlook on women in free software: "I have been looking into building ground level feminist perspectives into free and open source software (FOSS) to make the FOSS space more inclusive, expand it and free it from the impositions of the patriarchy. Towards this I have tried to educate quite a few FOSS and other activist groups on aspects of gender inclusiveness, diversity, combating sexism, micro-aggression, and rape culture."
Through my work with the Wikimedia Foundation, editing Wikipedia, and becoming a part of that Wiki-verse—as well as through conversations I've had with many women in technology at conferences like AdaCamp—I’ve realized that it’s not only gender but also a configuration of other identities like race, class, and colour that emerge as players in the dynamics of groups working on collaborative projects. For some they are obstacles, for others they are interesting aspects that enrich the process.
I also believe that there is a solid need to re-articulate these differences of gender, colour, discrimination, and most of all, the privileges given to bridge the gender gap. It is obviously not a question of allocating more resources to women but also of striving to create safe-spaces and the necessary support structure that can help women resist personal attacks, hostility, and confrontations without having to appear more masculine or justify their existence in open source and free knowledge communities.

Open source events grow at the university
By Luis Ibanez, Interview with Catherine Dumas (originally published January 2014)
Catherine Dumas is a PhD student in the College of Computing and Information (CCI) at the University at Albany at the State University of New York (SUNY). She teaches two undergraduate courses, one in the Computer Science department and one in the Informatics Department.
Aside from her PhD work and teaching, Catherine is very involved in encouraging men and women to pursue their dreams in the field. She does this by staying active in the student chapter of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIST) and in the activities going on at the College of Computing and Information Women in Technology (CCIWiT) group. Open source software is also a topic she's passionate about, and for the past three years she has helped organize the annual Open Source Festival at SUNY.
What repository do you use as a teacher?
We have adopted Git as a platform for developing software and hosting and sharing training materials among instructors. We have embraced Github as the hosting location for most of our repositories. In the past year we introduced Git as a topic for many of the technology classes and hosted training workshops on it. Git is now becoming a well known technology on campus. Check them on GitHub.
Does SUNY Albany encourage open source practices?
The College of Computing and Information has a very open attitude about open source software and its interplay in education. We have adopted many open source tools for teaching programming (from Scratch, to Python, PHP, Node.js and M/MUMPS), databases and web development, as well a support for non-technical writing, using platforms such as Wordpress and Wikispaces.
For my PhD work, both LaTeX and R are essential tools that I use, along with the storage and revision control of these files in Git.
What does the College of Computing and Information Women in Technology do for women?
It is an initiative that started with the New York Celebration of Women in Computing (NYCWiC), a bi-annual conference that was inspired by the Grace Hopper conference, but focused on the New York State area.
Out of this initiative, Jennifer Goodall, Assistant Dean at the Department of Informatics at the College of Computing and Information, created CCIWiT as a place for women to meet and share experiences on being a minority in the computer science and technology related fields at SUNY Albany.
The program also encourages girls in middle school and high school to pursue undergraduate and graduate studies in technology. One of the remarkable activities of CCIWiT is organizing the funding of female students to attend the annual Grace Hopper conference. This have been done for more than five years thanks to the sponsorship of SUNY Alumni and supporters.
The Grace Hopper conference can give many women, a minority in the field of technology, confidence and new ideas by bringing them together. What has been your experience?
I have attended the past four conferences and seen the growth of the event each year (about 4,000 attendees in 2013). It is an amazing experience to witness women from diverse backgrounds, academia, and industry alike, from all over the world, participating in workshops, talks, and training sessions. It is very inspiring to see the role models of successful women in technology and contrast it with the typical experience of being a minority in technology courses. It is a very empowering experience, and it has motivated me continue to pursue technology related initiatives and activities with confidence.

How has the Open Source Festival at SUNY Albany grown and evolved?
The first Open Source Festival brought together a small group of about eight presenters and twenty attendees, all from inside the campus. This changed quickly for the second Open Source Festival, which had about 150 attendees and two tracks of presentations. The third Open Source Festival was held in 2013 and had two tracks of presentations, with about 200 attendees from industry, state government, and academia. In 2013, we had hands-on workshops and career activities like mock interviews for students.
As part of ASIST activities, I was one of the founders of the first Open Source Festivals at SUNY Albany, back in 2010. A few of the presentations included: Zotero, Gimp, and we even had a student demo a Thing-O-Matic 3D printer. In that process, I learned quite a bit about the different open source tools available, as well as, the philosophy of the movement, the business models, and community activities.
The Open Source Festival has been very successful at introducing students from all backgrounds to the concepts of open source. This has made a great impact, even for students who are already in the technology field.
This year the Open Source Festival will take place on March 29, 2014. The day before, on March 28 we will hold a pre-festival day of workshops. Currently, we are inviting people to submit proposals for presentations. The keynote will be by members of the OpenStack community! And, we anticipate sessions inline with the Maker movement and open hardware, focusing on: Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, 3D printing.
Many open source-related activities took place during 2013 at SUNY Albany, so we're seeing the participation and nature of topics and discussions increase. Some of those activites were: workshops on the use of Git, training sessions on how to write defensive patent publications, and training on how to participate in the development of the Linux kernel.
The College of Computing and Information was asked to help the rare diseases community. What is that relationship like?
We got involved with the rare diseases community when we were approached by Ed Fennell who leads a forum on rare diseases at Albany Medical Center. Ed was looking for students to help him create an information system for supporting the families in their communities. Given our previous experience at workshops for ASIST, and given the great strides and learning that had been coming from the Open Source Festival, we understood the basics of what was needed to get students and faculty involved and helping. A hackathon was the perfect informal, collaborative environment; and we started a series of them, to work on developing open source software for the rare diseases communities.
What we learned with these hackathon events was that it is very important to create a space where everybody can participate and contribute. This implies that we have to resist the temptation for efficiency (which is a trace of managing scarcity) and instead ensure that activities are engaging and are covered in a redundant manner by multiple people (which is a trace of managing abundance).
It has been very rewarding to see all these volunteers, students, and faculty come together—attending and helping when their schedules allow, and working together for a common good.

Breaking down geek stereotypes in open source
By Jodi Biddle (originally published February 2014)
I'm a newcomer to the tech industry. I don't have a degree in Computer Science or Engineering. I'm a writer by trade and training, so coming to work for Red Hat after years of freelancing and crappy office jobs was a real shock. Which is to say, a pleasant shock. Tattoos? Sure. Pink hair? Oh, yes. Start time? Whatever suits you best. And unlike other places I've worked, not a single man has expected me to make them a cup of coffee, and nobody tells me to "smile love, nobody likes a sadsack in the office!" (I frown when I concentrate. I'm sorry! And by that I mean I'm totally not sorry.)
What's more, I work in a department full of women. This was also unexpected—I'd been led to believe that women didn't work in IT, and so I came in bracing for more male-dominated office life. But there are heaps of women in my office. Well, I should qualify—heaps of women on my floor. Engineering? Not so much. There are lots more women in the "periphery" of tech, such as technical writing and business management, but engineering is still hopelessly male-dominated. Why is that?
From the Women in Technology (WiT) Education Foundation:
"In 2008, women received 57% of all undergraduate degrees but represented only 18% of all Computer and Information Sciences undergraduate degrees. There has been a 79% decline, between 2000 and 2008, in the number of incoming undergraduate women interested in majoring in Computer Science. As a result, only 27% of computer scientists today are female."
I find that really interesting. In the course of researching this piece, I read a lot of troubling stories from women in the industry. This quote from an article in Fast Company stood out to me:
"It's tiring always being first, always being different, always being the one who has to adapt, denying important parts of yourself just to get the chance to do your job. It’s like being a stranger in a strange land, where you speak the language but nobody learns yours. That's why even women who do well in development end up leaving mid-career."
What is the strange land? What is the language of the tech industry? As a newcomer, and a woman, it's immediate and noticeable, but oddly hard to articulate. It goes deeper than the plethora of buzz-words and over-determined jargon. I think it's a cultural problem, and I don't just mean in the standard "men-and-women-can't-get-along" kind of way.
I don't mean to start a fight here, but I think the tech industry, and open source in particular, is snobby. Geek culture is so deeply insinuated into every part of this industry it forms a barrier of entry to everybody already not inducted by a nearly life-long process of immersion. Just like any culture, there are acceptable and unacceptable ways to dress, shows to watch, books to read, hobbies to engage in, and modes of communication.
It's also understandable to a degree how suspicious geeks can be of non-geeks. The exclusionary nature of geek culture works both ways: mainstream society's relationship with geek culture seems to be torn between opportunistic profiteering (Big Bang Theory) and downright antagonism (every "nerd" movie trope). But an unfortunate by-product of this is a seriously insular culture that has been wrapped around the tech industry. That culture could do a lot to be more welcoming in general, but more welcoming to women specifically.
It returns to this notion of working somewhere "where you speak the language but nobody learns yours." I'm nerdy, geeky, dorky, whatever. I was the weird kid in high school. I read comic books, I play Dungeons and Dragons. I also like shoes, and handbags, and musical theatre, and I pay too much for haircuts. I bulk-bought makeup in Walmart last time I was in the States like there was an oncoming fashion apocalypse.
Despite the fact that I definitely consider myself die-hard geeky, apparently I don't fit the girl-geek stereotype—maybe geek girls don't shave their heads and get a lot of tattoos? I lack the pre-requisite shyness? (It was a long slog but I grew out of it eventually...) I'm actually not sure why I get disqualified. I own a NASA shirt! Nonetheless, I therefore run the risk of being accused of the ultimate insult against geek puritanism: the fake geek girl. I won't speak too much about this recent phenomenon, but apparently now there are girls invading the land of geekdom and appropriating cultural icons as fashion accessories without any knowledge or understanding of their history or significance. I can see how this is problematic, and there's a big debate to be had about cultural appropriation there, but automatically dismissing anyone who isn't deemed "appropriately geeky"—especially women, because this vitriol seems to be focused on women—isn't exactly going to facilitate the kind of growth most of us would like to see in open source. Authenticity should only be discussed in terms of desire to be a part of the open source community, not in terms of what clothes you wear or what books you read.
Not only do I have to constantly prove my worth as a non-technical person in a highly technical world, I also have to contend with the notion that I'm just trying to disguise myself as someone nerdy in order to fit in with the misfits. (How does that logic even work?) So I ask you, if we can't even trust women from our own highly insular culture, then how are other women ever going to feel welcome in our industry, so caught up in said culture? By failing to disrupt the narrative that entwines geek culture with IT, we're alienating everyone who already feels like IT is inaccessible, especially women.
I nominate open source particularly because even by tech industry standards, this is the hardcore stuff. When I tell other IT people I work for a Linux company even they sometimes get the haunted look of somebody about to be bombarded with a bunch of stuff they don't know or care about. I really like it though. I like the passion people have. I like that innovation and progress are the big markers of success, and that good ideas are going to naturally work their way to the top. This sort of natural selection shouldn't be limited by who can produce some geek cred. I know it's worn like a badge of pride, but it shouldn't devalue other social structures, especially feminine social structures, in the process.
It's got to be hard to have the best ideas when we're missing a huge chunk of the population. Imagine how many brilliant potential software engineers are being lost to other industries because they feel like there isn't any space for pink high heels in IT? Should femininity be a foreign language barrier that women need to overcome in order to have a career? And why should women have to prove their geekiness even when it is genuine? We need to better delineate between the tech industry and geek culture, because ultimately, being snobby in open source is bad for business.

Like Arduino? Miniaturize your project with TinyCircuits
By Lauren Egts, Interview with Ken Burns (originally published January 2014)
When you walk into the cavernous, old tire plant of Canal Place in Akron, Ohio, the last thing that you'd expect to find in this big building is such a "tiny" treasure. Unexpected though it may be, this is where Ken Burns and the TinyCircuits team has set up shop, and it's where they make tiny open source hardware treasures: miniaturized Arduino compatible circuits.
Ken Burns is the founder of TinyCircuits and has always been fascinated with computers. He first got access to a computer, an Apple 2, when he was six years old at a local library, for only 15 minutes a week. He continued working with computers, earned a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Akron, and eventually began working at AVID Technologies, Inc., a company that does product design in Twinsburg.
At AVID, he says, "I noticed a common thread—smart sensor modules people would want put into their products." Eventually, he had the inspiration for TinyCircuits and started a business around open source hardware and electronics.
The TinyDunio won them the Internet of Things Award for Open Source Project of the Year in 2012.
TinyCircuits makes products exactly like what their name implies. The TinyDuino is the size of a quarter but is as powerful as the Arduino Uno. There are many different types of low cost, open source boards that are made at TinyCircuits. The most popular product is the TinyDuino starter kit (includes the processor board, USB board, and proto boards). TinyCircuits' electronics also have the expandability of an Arduino board. Using TinyShields, you can snap on capabilities like an accelerometer, WiFi, and GPS.
"The difference is the miniaturization of it while maintaining the expandability of the core Arduino platform. We have a miniature platform that you can still expand on. It is fairly easy to add WiFi, GPS, motor control. It keeps the simplicity of the Arduino and keeps it useful for projects that need to be small."
TinyCircuits got its start in 2011 with a lot of help from the open source community. The team was able to raise over $100,000 in donations from their Kickstarter campaign to start manufacturing and distributing TinyCircuits. This also kickstarted a community of followers, users, and supporters, particularly those who were already users of Arduino boards. Because TinyCircuit products are compatible with the Arduino products, the company fulfills the need of a niche market and leverages the Arduino community. 
"The traditional view of open source is about software. Open source hardware has been around for about 7 to 10 years. Making hardware open and building a community around it is a huge advantage in hardware like in software," Burns said. "The community behind it keeps it alive, keeps it useful."
Many users have come up with exceptional uses for TinyCircuits due to their low power usage, customability, and size. For example, a PhD student from England was better able to observe climate data over large expanses of land. He used his TinyCircuits to measure the basic environmental factors of an African game preserve for a year, and thus he had more data points and all for a much lower cost than the typical, expensive equipment.
TinyCircuits can also "stir a kid's imagination and make them use their engineering mind even though they might not think they have one yet," said Burns. Users tend to primarily be hobbyists and students who are already somewhat familiar with the Arduino board and other open source electronics, but who have a need to 'miniaturize' their projects.

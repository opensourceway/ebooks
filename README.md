Collections of our articles around a particular theme or topic.

At Opensource.com we share hundreds of stories about the power of open source principles—transparency, community, participation, collaboration, meritocracy, rapid prototyping, and sharing. Each tale is the fruit of an ongoing, global conversation between people living and working the open source way.

Our Open Voices ebooks collect some of the most compelling articles and interviews we’ve published over the years. We produce them using open source tools and publish them in open formats—free of DRM.
